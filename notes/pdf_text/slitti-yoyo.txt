1SLITTI
Luciano Slitti founded Slitti in 1969 in Montecatini Terme, Tuscany, Italy, as a coffee roasting company. When 
Luciano passed control of the company to his son Andrea in 1988, Slitti was already a respected name in the 
coffee world. A few years later, his brother Daniele joined him, and together, they successfully carried on their 
father's work. But Andrea had a bigger ambition: chocolate.
In 1990, Andrea, inspired by his growing passion for chocolate, decided to expand Slitti's production to include 
chocolate.
Andrea Slitti is known for his careful selection of raw materials and his passion for his job. He has won many 
awards, including the Grand Prix International de la Chocolaterie in 1994 and the Eurochocolate Award in 1996,  
and was named the best chocolatier in Italy in 2008.

perfectly over it, without the addition of other  ingredients.
