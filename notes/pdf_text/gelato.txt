HOW DOES IT LOOK?
HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?
●Take a cup and hold it by its bottom.
●Prepare flavour/s of choice with the scoop spatula - scoop the gelato in a straight line from one side to 
another to soften it and make it ready to go in the cup.
●Clear the spoon of gelato on the corner of the pan.
●Scoop the gelato off the pan back on the spatula by creating a ball.
●Slide gelato on one side of the cup, press the gelato gently to remove air bubbles from inside.
●Offer customers a wafer: if they would like one, add it on top of the gelato.
●Add the spoon and hand it to the customer with a smile.  
TIPS & TRICKS:  
Children can have two flavours in a small cup.

portions of semifreddo and cakes.
HOW DO YOU STORE IT?
●The display freezer - vertical vitrine, needs to be at least at -14 and free of ice at all times (that’s why 
it’s important to defrost the vertical vitrine once a week)
●Always try to maximise the space and display as many products as possible  
●Always display the cakes on the higher shelf at an adult-eye level, cookies and Pinguinos on the lower 
shelf  at a kids-eye level

GELATO DISPLAY
PREPARATION IN THE MORNING:
●In the morning, take a wet cloth and with hot water and the yellow sanitiser, clean the gelato vetrina 
from the gelato stains from the day before. If the vetrina is really messy you can use a sponge.
●Take the blue spray and blue roll and clean all metal surfaces - make them shine!  
●Put the bars that hold the gelato pans in place and switch on the machine.  
●Place the metal pans in position.
●Clean the sliding doors from any gelato stain, and place them in position.
●Once the machine reaches the temperature of -14/-15, place the gelato on display; always check the 
scampoli freezer first to see if the gelato from the day before can be utilised - if the pan is a scampolo 
(less than ¼ of the pan) then display a new one.  
●Add the gelato spatulas for serving.
●Close the sliding doors and be ready to serve.
IMPORTANT:
All the spatulas used to clean up the gelato must be washed after any use and dry with blue roll paper before 
being used again on other flavours.

MAINTAINING THE VETRINA
●The vetrina needs to be switched off every night and deep cleaned once a week.
●Filters need to be cleaned once a week.
●If the store is not busy the sliding doors need to be in place to preserve the temperature of the gelato.
How to deep clean the vetrina:
1.Remove the bottom panels  
2.Take a wet sponge and remove all gelato stains  
3.Remove any nuts or crumbs inside the machine  
4.With the sanitising  spray and a clean cloth sanitise all surfaces  
5.With blue spray and blue roll make all the surfaces shine  
6.Replace the panels in position  
7.Sanitise and shine all the bars and metal gelato pans  
8.Deep clean all the label stands  
9.Switch on the machine  
SCAMPOLI 
When a flavour has less than ¼  of gelato left in the pan, it is a scampolo and it must be replaced with a new 
pan.
Scampolo can be added a bit at a time to the new flavour of gelato.  
How to add a Scampolo to the gelato  
1.Take the gelato from the scampolo storage freezer  
2.Take a small amount of gelato (the side of one scoop - approximately 100 g) and add it to the gelato 
pan in the vitrine
3.Repeat the action until you have filled up the pan - remember, the maximum of scampolo that can be 
added has to be no more than 5 to 7 cm
4.Take a spatula and level up the gelato added making it look like it wasn’t added afterwards.
